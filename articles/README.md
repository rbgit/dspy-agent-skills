# Articles

Four how-to articles on [dspy-agent-skills](..), written for AI and LLM enthusiasts who have heard of DSPy, GEPA, and RLM but haven't yet put them to work. Designed to ship across X.com (long-form articles), LinkedIn, and my Code and Context blog.

| # | Title | Focus | Est. read |
|---|---|---|---|

| [02](02-how-to-install-and-use.md) | How to install and use dspy-agent-skills | Install paths, first session, troubleshooting | 5 min |
| [03](03-inside-the-examples.md) | Inside the examples | Real GEPA improvement numbers, the saturation lesson | 9 min |
| [04](04-future-use-cases.md) | Where dspy-agent-skills goes next | Composition patterns, production, contribution | 7 min |

## Image placeholders

Each article ships inline `<!-- IMAGE PROMPT (Nano Banana): "..." -->` comments describing hero and diagram images. Generate with Gemini Nano Banana (or the image model of your choice) and replace the `placeholder-*.png` filenames with the final assets.

## Writing notes

The articles were drafted and then passed through the `writing-humanizer` skill: em dashes reduced, filler phrases removed, inline-header bullet lists converted to paragraphs, common AI-prose patterns excised. The articles aren't fully em-dash-free (some remain in section headings and code snippets where they read cleanly), but the rhetorical "Not X—it's Y" and setup-em-dash patterns are gone. If you spot a line that still reads as AI-generated, [open an issue](https://github.com/intertwine/dspy-agent-skills/issues).
