## The committed numbers

Three examples. All three runs used `auto="light"` and `seed=0`, free OpenRouter models only, a single reflection LM (Nemotron-3-super-120B-a12b). Total spend to reproduce: zero dollars if you stay inside OpenRouter's free tier.

| Example | Task LM | Baseline | Optimized | Δ | Mutations accepted |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| [01 RAG QA with citations](https://github.com/intertwine/dspy-agent-skills/tree/main/examples/01-rag-qa) | GLM 4.5 Air (32B) | 81.15 | **100.00** | +18.85 | 1 |
| [02 multi-step math reasoning](https://github.com/intertwine/dspy-agent-skills/tree/main/examples/02-math-reasoning) | Liquid LFM 2.5 (1.2B) | 45.00 | **70.00** | +25.00 | 5 |
| [03 typed invoice extraction](https://github.com/intertwine/dspy-agent-skills/tree/main/examples/03-invoice-extraction) | Liquid LFM 2.5 (1.2B) | 0.833 | **0.931** | +0.098 | 5 |

**Caveats you should hold in your head while reading the rest.** These are single-seed runs on small train/val splits (15–34 train, 9–12 val). They're toy-but-real demos, not a benchmark. Free-tier provider behaviour shifts over time, so a re-run won't be perfectly deterministic; expect a few points of drift. For rigorous numbers, the [GEPA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457) and the [DSPy AIME tutorial](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/gepa_aime/) are the right references.

I'll walk each example top-to-bottom, then end with the saturation lesson that forced me to pick a 1.2B task LM for two of them.

## Example 01: RAG QA with citations

**The task.** Twelve short articles about the solar system (one per planet plus a few moons). Twenty-five labeled questions split fifteen-train / ten-val, each with a single authoritative source. The program retrieves top-3 passages via BM25, then passes them to a `dspy.ChainOfThought` that must emit both an answer *and* the doc IDs it used as evidence.

```python
class AnswerWithCitation(dspy.Signature):
    """Given retrieved passages, answer the question concisely and cite the
    passage IDs used as evidence."""
    context: str = dspy.InputField()
    question: str = dspy.InputField()
    answer: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="short, factual answer — no prose padding")
    citations: list[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="doc IDs from the context that support the answer")
```

**The metric.** Three weighted axes:

- Correctness (weight 0.55): fuzzy substring or token-overlap match against gold.
- Citation validity (0.30): at least one cited doc ID is in the gold set; extras are penalized.
- Conciseness (0.15): 3–25 words, penalty either side.

The metric returns `dspy.Prediction(score, feedback)` where `feedback` names the failing axis with specifics. That's what lets the reflection LM learn what to fix.

**What GEPA did.** Iteration 1 produced an instruction that scored perfect on the full valset. GEPA spent the rest of the budget correctly refusing to mutate. Every subsequent minibatch was all-correct, so there was no signal. The final `optimized_program.json` is a 2.4 KB state file you can load in a separate Python process:

```python
import dspy
dspy.configure(lm=dspy.LM("openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free", ...))
program = RagQA(retriever=BM25Retriever(docs))
program.load("optimized_program.json")
print(program(question="What is the orbital period of Mars?").answer)
# → '687 Earth days'
```

The improvement (+18.85 points) came from GEPA teaching the synthesizer to consistently emit citations even for questions where the model "knew" the answer from pretraining. That's a format problem, not a knowledge problem. Exactly the kind of thing prompt optimization was built for.

## Example 02: multi-step math reasoning

**The task.** Thirty-four grade-school word problems with compound percentages, work-rate problems, weighted averages, and distractor-laden setups. The program is a plain `dspy.ChainOfThought("problem -> answer")`. No tools, no external data, just reasoning.

Each data point ships a `trap` field: a one-line description of the common mistake. The metric uses it in feedback so the reflection LM learns *structural fixes* (step enumeration, unit tracking) rather than memorizing individual answers.

```json
{
  "problem": "A $200 item is marked up 25%, then discounted 20% on the marked-up price. What is the final price?",
  "answer": 200,
  "trap": "200*1.25=250, 250*0.8=200. The sequence matters; do NOT add the percentages."
}
```

**Why a 1.2B model.** This is where the saturation story starts. I ran the example first with GLM 4.5 Air (32B). Baseline: 83.33%. Ran it again with Ministral 8B. Baseline: 93.33%. Both runs accepted zero mutations. Every GEPA minibatch was all-correct, so the reflection LM was never called.

The issue isn't GEPA. Modern 8B-plus open-weight models have effectively saturated grade-school word problems. To actually see GEPA improve a program, I needed a task LM that fails on enough examples for there to be signal. [Liquid LFM 2.5 (1.2B)](https://openrouter.ai/liquid/lfm-2.5-1.2b-instruct:free) fit the bill: baseline 45.00%.

**What GEPA did.** Twenty-three iterations. Five accepted mutations (at iters 2, 3, 4, 6, 10). Candidate 4 hit the final valset score of 70.00%: a 25-point improvement entirely from rewriting the ChainOfThought instruction. The final instruction prescribes explicit step numbering, unit tracking, and a verification pass before committing the final number.

Total time: ~23 minutes on the free tier with `num_threads=1`.

Five distinct candidate markers (small colored circles labeled 'C1', 'C2', 'C3', 'C4', 'C5') are placed at iterations 2, 3, 4, 6, 10 respectively, climbing up to 0.70.

## Example 03: typed invoice extraction

**The task.** Pull a typed `InvoiceRecord` out of unstructured invoice text: vendor, date (normalized to YYYY-MM-DD regardless of source format), line items with description/quantity/unit_price, and final total (after tax/shipping/discounts). The output is a Pydantic model:

```python
class InvoiceRecord(BaseModel):
    vendor: str
    date: str
    line_items: list[LineItem]
    total: float
```

The program is a `dspy.ChainOfThought("invoice_text -> record: InvoiceRecord")`. DSPy handles the Pydantic serialization round-trip automatically.

**The metric.** Five axes: schema validity (0.20), vendor match (0.15), date match (0.15), line-item F1 (0.35), total match (0.15). Feedback calls out each failing axis with specifics. F1 is computed on the set of `(fuzzy_description, quantity, unit_price)` triples, so collapsing two rows into one or splitting one row into two gets penalized as you'd expect.

**The data traps.** To prevent the same saturation I hit on ex02, I wrote invoices with deliberate gotchas:

- Dates in DD-MM-YYYY, "March 8, 2024", and "22 September 2024" formats.
- Headers with both a **seller** (vendor) and a distinct **bill-to** / **shipper** entity. The gold extraction always wants the seller.
- Discount and rebate rows that reduce the total but are *not* line items.
- Freight and handling lines that are *also* not line items.
- Tax-inclusive vs. pre-tax totals where the model has to pick the right "final" number.

**What GEPA did.** Five accepted mutations, final valset score 0.931 (baseline 0.833, +0.098). The winning candidate's instruction explicitly tells the extractor to pick the FROM: block's entity as `vendor`, to exclude freight/handling from `line_items`, and to use the most terminal total in the text.

Total time: ~36 minutes. This run exhausted OpenRouter's 2000 req/day free cap right before the final re-eval. The committed scores are GEPA's own cached full-valset evaluations (used for candidate selection), which is what you'd want: the same number GEPA optimized against.

## The saturation lesson

Two out of three examples use a **1.2B-parameter** task LM. That's deliberate.

GEPA shines when there's signal to work with. If the baseline is already 0.95 on a task, every minibatch GEPA samples is all-correct, the reflection LM is never called, and the optimizer correctly no-ops. This is **not a bug**. It's GEPA's designed behavior: don't propose changes when there's nothing to improve.

But for a *demo*, a no-op is a boring story. So I went looking for a task-model/task combination that produced enough failure signal for GEPA to actually exercise. Most of the smaller free-tier models I tried had disqualifying problems: Gemma 3 4B on OpenRouter rejects system prompts outright, and several others hit structural format-output limits that make Pydantic-typed extraction impossible. Above 8B, grade-school math and typed extraction are already solved. Liquid LFM 2.5 at 1.2B was the smallest free-tier model I could find that still accepts the DSPy prompt shape, and it ended up being the sweet spot for this demo.

The practical implication: **if you run the pack and see baseline == optimized, check the difficulty of your data relative to your task LM**. Either harden the data, weaken the task LM, or accept that the task is solved and spend your optimization budget somewhere that matters. [Arize's independent benchmark](https://arize.com/blog/gepa-vs-prompt-learning-benchmarking-different-prompt-optimization-approaches/) of GEPA against other optimizers makes the same point with different wording: optimizer choice matters less than metric quality and task difficulty.

## The $0 reproducibility promise

Every committed number in the table above came from a single run with `seed=0`. The model choices are captured in each example's `results.json`. The optimized programs are committed as `optimized_program.json` alongside the source, so you can load and re-score them against fresh data without re-running GEPA. (Seeding does not guarantee bit-exact reproducibility here: free-tier endpoints don't expose deterministic sampling, so a fresh run with the same seed will drift a few points.)

To reproduce:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/intertwine/dspy-agent-skills
cd dspy-agent-skills
cp .env.example .env  # fill in OPENROUTER_API_KEY

cd examples/02-math-reasoning
DSPY_TASK_MODEL=openrouter/liquid/lfm-2.5-1.2b-instruct:free \
  uv run --with dspy --with python-dotenv \
  python run.py --optimize --auto light --seed 0
```

About 20–45 minutes depending on free-tier congestion. Expect a few points of drift from the committed numbers (see the caveats at the top).

## What the examples aren't

The point of the three demos is to show the *shape* of a GEPA loop end-to-end on a single machine in under an hour, not to claim state-of-the-art on any task. For rigorous benchmark comparisons, the [GEPA paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19457) is the source and the [DSPy AIME tutorial](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/gepa_aime/) shows a proper benchmark run.

## Next

[Article 4](04-future-use-cases.md) sketches the composition patterns I'm most excited about: RLM inside a GEPA-optimized module, multi-agent workflows where one program optimizes another, and production deployment patterns that take a saved program into a real service.
